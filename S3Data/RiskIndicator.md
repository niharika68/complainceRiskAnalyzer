# 340B Program Management Risk Indicators

## Overview

Covered entities must maintain proper controls to ensure compliant management of accumulations, patient eligibility matching, and referral capture processes.

Failure to monitor these operational indicators may increase risk of diversion, duplicate discounts, or program inefficiencies.

## Negative Accumulation Ordering Risk

Ordering drugs while accumulation balances are negative may indicate inventory control weaknesses.

Risk thresholds:

- 0–5 occurrences per month: Low Risk
- 6–15 occurrences per month: Medium Risk
- More than 15 occurrences per month: High Risk

This condition may signal premature ordering or incorrect accumulation tracking.

## Match Rate Decline Risk

Match rate represents the percentage of dispenses successfully linked to eligible patient encounters.

Risk thresholds:

- Above 85%: Low Risk
- 70% to 85%: Medium Risk
- Below 70%: High Risk

Low match rates may indicate incomplete documentation or eligibility classification issues.

---

## Referral Capture Under-Utilization Risk

Referral capture rate indicates how effectively eligible referral prescriptions are incorporated into the program.

Risk thresholds:

- Above 60%: Low Risk
- 40% to 60%: Medium Risk
- Below 40%: High Risk

Low referral capture may indicate operational inefficiencies or missed program opportunities.

## Compliance Monitoring Guidance

Regular monitoring of these indicators helps covered entities maintain program integrity and reduce audit risks.

Operational risk signals should be reviewed alongside regulatory updates and internal compliance policies.
